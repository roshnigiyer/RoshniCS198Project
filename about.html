IS THIS FOR ME? <BR>
--------------- <BR> <BR>
Are a person who likes to drive or just explore? Alternatively, do you travel with your family, large groups of people, or just travel for long distances? If so, no longer do you have to search for those much needed food or restroom breaks, or those much anticipated scenic routes. Trip Maps is here to accomodate all of your needs! <BR>

OKAY, WHAT IS TRIP MAPS?<BR>
------------------------ <BR> <BR>
Trip Maps is an enhanced form of Google Maps. <BR>
By this we mean the following:<BR>

Like Google Maps, Trip Maps keeps track of a starting point and a destination point. <BR>
The starting point is the trip's beginning or current location, <BR>
and the destination point is the trip's end or current location. <BR>

Unlike Google Maps, Trip Maps tracks interesting places along the given route. By default, trip maps finds museums and national parks along a route and generates a trip map route for the user to visit while reaching the destination. Alternatively, the user fill a profile of places of interest that trip maps will use to generate its route. Additionally, the user can also specify how often to visit interesting places or how many such places to visit. For example, a preference can be to visit food stops every 1 hour. Another preference could be to include 3 restroom stops. By default, trip maps will visit each type of interesting place once.
