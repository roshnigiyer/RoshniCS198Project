OKAY, WHAT IS TRIP MAPS? <BR>
---------------------------------- <BR><BR>

<H3>
Trip Maps is an enhanced form of Google Maps. <BR>
By this we mean the following:<BR> <BR>

Like Google Maps, Trip Maps keeps track of a starting point and a destination point. The starting point <BR> is the trip's beginning or current location, and the destination point is the trip's end or <BR>current location. <BR>

Unlike Google Maps, Trip Maps tracks interesting places along the given route. By default, trip maps <BR>
finds museums and national parks along a route and generates a trip map route for the user to visit <BR> while reaching the destination. Alternatively, the user fill a profile of places of interest that trip <BR>
maps will use to generate its route. Additionally, the user can also specify how often to visit <BR>interesting places or how many such places to visit. For example, a preference can be to visit food <BR> stops every 1 hour. Another preference could be to include 3 restroom stops. By default, trip maps <BR>
will visit each type of interesting place once.  <BR>
