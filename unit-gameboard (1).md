# Unit Types & Game Board Impact

For PoNG, each unit may attack at the hex where they have been revealed through the signaling token.  A military signaling token can only be placed a certain distance from a light (LT) or hardended (HT) military base.  To fit the TBS Framework, the actions would be the following:

* Click on hex with a military base
* Select unit you want to use 
* Unit moves to location from base (limited by distance)
* Unit performs attack 

An attack is deemed successful only if the attack dice roll value above the set threshold for success.  This document outlines for each unit:  the value required for success and how difficulty may increase, the cost to use conduct the attack, how the board is impacted following a successful attack, and how the board is impacted if the attack fails or unit malfunctions.  

If a player does not have enough funds, they cannot conduct the attack for the unit.  

## Conventional military
* **Distance From Base**:  Max of 5 hexes away from LT or HT base

* **Successful Attack**:  4 or higher on empty hex
	* Additional difficulty:
    	- +2 if hex has civilian infrastructure
    	- +3 if hex has military structure
    	- +5 if opponents want to defend (defender must have base at least 8 hexes from target hex)

* **Cost**: 2 + distance from closest base + (1 oil OR 3 more currency)
    
* **Impact on-board, if successful**:  
	* Country takes ownership of hex.
	* Unit removed from the board

* **Impact on-board, if failed attack**:  
	* No ownership change for hex
	* Unit removed from the board


## Conventional missile
* **Distance From Base**:  Max of 12 hexes away from HT base

* **Successful Attack**:  2 or higher on empty hex

* **Cost**: 4
    
* **Impact on-board, if successful**:  
	* Disables infrastructure on the hex
	* Hex ownership remains the same
	* Unit removed from the board

* **Impact on-board, if failed attack**:  
	* Additional dice role occurs to determine extent of damage:		* Value 1 thru 6:  No damage effect
		* Value 7 thru 9:  Rocket hits different hex.  Pick random direction and distance (no more than 3) from the target.  Rocket disables any infrastructure on impacted hex.
		* Value 10 thru 11:  Rocket hits hex adjacent to target on path & disables any infrastructure 
		* Value 12:  Rocket explodes at base, disables base


## Standard NW
* **Distance From Base**:  Max of 12 hexes away from HT base

* **Successful Attack**:  2 or higher on empty hex

* **Cost**: 4
    
* **Impact on-board, if successful**:  
	* Destroys infrastructure and population on hex and adjacent hexes
	* All impacted hexes are unusuable for the remainder of the game
	* Unit removed from the board

* **Impact on-board, if failed attack**:  
	* Additional dice role occurs to determine extent of damage:		* Value 1 thru 6:  No damage effect
		* Value 7 thru 9:  NW hits different hex.  Pick random direction and distance (no more than 3) from the target.    Destorys impacted hex and all adjacent hexes
		* Value 10 thru 11:  NW hits hex adjacent to target on path.  Destroys impacted hex and all adjacent hexes.
		* Value 12:  NW explodes at base, destroys hex and all adjacent hexes


## EMP
* **Distance From Base**:  Max of 12 hexes away from HT base

* **Successful Attack**:  Always successful

* **Cost**: 4
    
* **Impact on-board, if successful**:  
	* Disables infrastructure on hex and adjacent hexes
	* Unit removed from the board

* **Impact on-board, if failed attack**:  
	* Not applicable


## Tailored Radiation
* **Distance From Base**:  Max of 12 hexes away from HT base

* **Successful Attack**:  Always successful

* **Cost**: 4
    
* **Impact on-board, if successful**:  
	* Destroys population at the target hex
	* Unit removed from the board

* **Impact on-board, if failed attack**:  
	* Not applicable


## Low Yield
* **Distance From Base**:  Max of 12 hexes away from HT base

* **Successful Attack**:  Always successful

* **Cost**: 4
    
* **Impact on-board, if successful**:  
	* Destroys population and infrastructure at the target hex
	* Hex is unusable for the remainder of the game
	* Unit removed from the board
